SMOKEGIOS
=========

ABOUT
-----
Smokegios is a small Perl5 application that reads a Nagios configuration file
and generates Smokeping configuration for all the hosts defined.

Hosts are automatically generated in structures based on the hostgroup definitions
in Nagios - note that at least one hostgroup definition is must for this program
to work and any hosts not in a host group will be ignored.

The application should be called regularly (eg once an hour), it will check if
Nagios's configuration has changed and if so, will generate new Smokeping config
and reload the daemon.


INSTALLATION
------------

See the pkg/ directory for distribution-provided package definitions such as RPM.

1. Install bin/smokegios.pl and etc/smokegios.conf to the desired locations.

# cp bin/smokegios.pl /usr/bin/smokegios
# cp etc/smokegios.conf /etc/smokeping/smokegios.conf

2. Adjust the configuration to suit requirements.

# vi /etc/smokeping/smokegios.conf

3. Touch the log file & optionally install logrotate configuration from pkg/smokegios.logrotate.conf

# touch /var/log/smokegios
# cp pkg/smokegios.logrotate.conf /etc/logrotate.d/smokegios

4. Configure cronjob to execute on a regular basis - or install pkg/smokegios.cron

# cp pkg/smokegios.cron /etc/cron.d/smokegios
# chmod +x /etc/cron.d/smokegios

5. Make sure smokeping has the following lines in it's configuration file:

### Smokegios Start ###
### Smokegios End ###


6. Complete - run the script with -v to debug for first execution.
